Save the partition info for a server node by sending a message to the local
host. This will store the partition info in the database.

This file is a copy of 'partitions-save' which is connected to the
'client' graph. We need two files because of ordering: we want to save
the partitions as early as possible on client nodes so we order
'partitions-save' off 'HEAD', but for server nodes, we need to wait for
the database to be configured, so we order 'partitions-save-server' off 'TAIL'.
