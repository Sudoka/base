<title> Frontend Central Server </title>

<para>
A Central Server is a Rocks Frontend node that can kickstart other frontends and provide rolls over the network, in a process called WAN kickstart. All Rocks frontends have the ability to act as central servers.
</para>

<para>
From Rocks 3.3.0 onwards, the standard distribution in /home/install/rocks-dist contains a distro suitable for WAN kickstart. The only steps you must take is to open "www" and "https" access on your frontend for the purpose of RPM package transfer. See <xref linkend="enable-www">.

<note>
<para>
Ensure that the hostname on central is fully qualified. Specifically, the "PublicHostname" value in the <literal>app_globals</literal> table of the database must be correct and reachable from the outside world.

All frontends will serve the rolls they were built with to client frontends,
but often it is advantageous to serve other rolls as well.

<para>
First, you must download the Roll ISO image to your central.
Then, execute:
