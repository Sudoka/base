<title> Managing the Firewall on the Cluster Nodes </title>

<para>
The firewall for all cluster nodes (including the frontend) is managed with
the Rocks command line.
In this section, we'll describe how to open and close ports for cluster nodes.
</para>

<section>
<title> Opening a Port in a Node's Firewall </title>

<para>
We'll use the example of opening port 80 (the 'www' service) for the public
network of compute-0-0.
To open the port, execute:
</para>

<screen>
# rocks open host firewall compute-0-0 network=public protocol=tcp service=www
</screen>

<para>
Then we can see the what the resulting firewall rules will look like:
</para>

<screen>
<![CDATA[
# rocks report host firewall compute-0-0
<file name="/etc/sysconfig/iptables" perms="500">
*filter
:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:FORWARD DROP [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
-A INPUT -i eth0 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i eth1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i eth1 -p tcp --dport ssh -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i eth1 -p tcp --dport www -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 0:1024 -j REJECT
-A INPUT -p udp --dport 0:1024 -j REJECT
COMMIT
</file>
]]>
</screen>

<para>
In the above example, eth0 is associated with the private network and
eth1 is associated with the public network.
</para>

<para>
Notice the line: "-A INPUT -i eth1 -p tcp --dport www -j ACCEPT".
This is the line in the firewall configuration that will allow web traffic to
flow in and out of compute-0-0.
</para>

<para>
Now apply the configuration to the host:
</para>

<screen>
# rocks sync host network compute-0-0
</screen>

<para>
The host will now accept web traffic on its public interface.
</para>

</section>


<section>
<title> Closing a Port in a Node's Firewall </title>

<para>
We'll use the example of closing port 3306 (the 'mysql' service) for the public
network of compute-0-0.
To close the port, execute:
</para>

<screen>
# rocks close host firewall compute-0-0 network=public protocol=tcp service=3306
</screen>

<para>
Now apply the configuration to the host:
</para>

<screen>
# rocks sync host network compute-0-0
</screen>

<para>
The host will now block all traffic to port 3306 on its public interface.
</para>
