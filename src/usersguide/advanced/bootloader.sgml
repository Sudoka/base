<title> Controlling Bootloader Parameters</title>

<para>
The default parameters for the GRUB bootloader is the master boot record
on the first BIOS-enabled drive. However, sometimes more control is needed
to support alternative configurations or to work around either anaconda 
(the installer) issues or platform BIOS problems. For Rocks version 6,
the default parameters are
</para>
<screen>
--location=mbr --timeout=5 
</screen>
<para>
These are encoded into the base.xml configuration node and is part of the base roll.
</para>


<para>
It is possible to completely override the default with the <emphasis>Bootloader</emphasis> attribute. This affects the generation of the node's kickstart file. The most common change is the <emphasis>--driveorder</emphasis> option to tell
anaconda precisely which device is the first in the BIOS boot order. 
In the following example, we set the driveorder to "sda" for node 
<computeroutput>compute-0-0</computeroutput>.
</para>

<screen>
# rocks set host attr compute-0-0 Bootloader value="--location=mbr --timeout=5 --driveorder=sda" 
</screen>

<para>
One can check the value as follows
</para>
<screen>
# rocks list host attr compute-0-0 | grep Bootloader
compute-0-0: Bootloader     --location=mbr --timeout=5 --driveorder=sda H     
</screen>

<para>
We see that <computeroutput>compute-0-0</computeroutput> has the Bootloader 
attribute set.  The "H" indicates that this attribute is a Host-specific 
attribute.
</para>


<warning>
<para>
If you define a Bootloader attribute, you must include 
the <computeroutput>--location=</computeroutput> directive. This is an 
Anaconda requirement
