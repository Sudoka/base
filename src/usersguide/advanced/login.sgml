<title> Adding a Login Appliance to Your Cluster </title>

<para>
A <emphasis>login appliance</emphasis> is a host that users use to build,
launch and monitor their application(s).
This host is a subset of a frontend appliance (a frontend runs several other
services that are used to install and maintain all the nodes in the system).
</para>

<para>
First, we need to perform the initial installation of the login appliance.
On the frontend, execute:
</para>

<screen>
# insert-ethers
</screen>

<para>
Select "Login" as the appliance type.
</para>

<para>
Then PXE boot the host that you want to be a login appliance.
</para>

<para>
Login hosts are generally hosts that also have a public network interface
so users can directly access the login host.
After the login appliance installs, to configure the public network interface
on the login host, see <xref linkend="adding-public-ip">.
</para>


<section>
<title> Making any Host a Submission and/or Execution Host </title>

<para>
If you've installed a batch queueing system (e.g., by using the SGE Roll or
Torque Roll), you can change any host in your system to be a submission host
(a host where users can submit jobs) and/or an execution host (the queueing
system schedules jobs on execution hosts).
</para>

<note>
<para>
By default, a login host is a submission host, but not an execution host.
By default, a compute node is an execution host, but not a submission host.
</para>
</note>

<para>
To make a host a submission host (e.g., tile-0-0), on the frontend execute:
</para>

<screen>
# rocks set host attr tile-0-0 submit_host true
</screen>

<para>
Then reinstall tile-0-0.
</para>

<para>
To make a host an execution host (e.g., tile-0-0), on the frontend execute:
</para>

<screen>
# rocks set host attr tile-0-0 exec_host true
</screen>

<para>
Then reinstall tile-0-0.
</para>
