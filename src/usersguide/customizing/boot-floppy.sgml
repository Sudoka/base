<title> Customizing a Boot Floppy </title>

<para>
For compute nodes without a CD or a PXE-enabled network card, there are
instances where the base RedHat boot floppy image does not support the
node's network card.
The following procedure describes how to customize the drivers that are
included in the boot floppy image.
</para>

<para>
First, check out the Rocks source code.
See <xref linkend="source-access"> for details.
</para>

<para>
Change into the directory where you will build the boot floppy:
</para>

<screen>
# cd src/rocks/boot/&redhat-version-x86;/images/i386
</screen>

<para>
Edit the file <computeroutput>boot-floppy-drivers</computeroutput> and
replace one (or more) of the existing driver names with your
desired drivers.
</para>

<para>
Build the boot floppy image.
</para>

<screen>
# make
</screen>

<para>
The new boot floppy image is named
<computeroutput>bootnet.rocks</computeroutput>.
Copy this image to a floppy disk:
</para>

<screen>
# dd if=bootnet.rocks of=/dev/fd0
</screen>

<para>
Put the floppy into your first compute node and follow the procedure
described at <xref linkend="install-compute-nodes">.
</para>
