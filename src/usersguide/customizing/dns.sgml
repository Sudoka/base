<para>
Rocks provides a mechanism to put external hostnames under the DNS control of
your cluster. Generally, external hosts have names served by site-wide DNS
servers. However if there is no external DNS server available, you may want to
use your frontend's DNS server to handle the name to IP mappings for certain
non-cluster nodes.

</para>

<para>
Since the DNS configuration file is automatically generated Rocks, you
cannot add static configuration to the standard zone files in /var/named.
Instead, you need to put local name mappings in the file:

</para>

<para>
<literal>
/var/named/rocks.domain.local
</literal>
</para>

<para>
And reverse mappings (IP to name) in:
</para>

<para>
<literal>
/var/named/reverse.rocks.domain.local-network-prefix.local
</literal>
</para>

<para>
Where <emphasis>local-network-prefix</emphasis> for a default rocks is
<emphasis>10</emphasis>.
That is, the above file name would be:
</para>

<para>
<literal>
/var/named/reverse.rocks.domain.10.local
</literal>
</para>

<para>
To add the mappings in the above <emphasis>.local</emphasis> files to the
running configuration, execute:
</para>

<screen>
# insert-ethers --update
</screen>

<para>
These files are in the BIND configuration format, just like the standard
<literal>rocks.domain</literal> and <literal>reverse.rocks.domain</literal>
files.
</para>

<note>
<para>
Your external hosts will have names in the .local cluster domain.
</para>
</note>

<warning>
<para>
Errors in your local DNS files will cause the entire local cluster domain naming
to fail. Proceed with caution.
</para>
