<title> Adding Applications to Compute Nodes </title>

<para>
If you have code you'd like to share among the compute nodes, but your
code isn't in an RPM (or in a roll), then this procedure describes how
you can share it with NFS.
</para>

<para>
On the frontend, go to the directory
<computeroutput>/export/apps</computeroutput>.
</para>

<screen>
# cd /export/apps
</screen>

<para>
Then add the files you'd like to share within this directory.
</para>

<para>
All files will be available on the compute nodes under:
<computeroutput>/share/apps</computeroutput>.
For example:
</para>

<screen>
# cd /export/apps
# touch myapp
# ssh compute-0-0
# cd /share/apps
# ls
myapp
</screen>
