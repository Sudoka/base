<title>Preface</title>

<para>

Since May 2000, the Rocks group has been addressing the
difficulties of deploying manageable clusters.  We have been driven by one
goal: <emphasis>make clusters easy</emphasis>. By
<emphasis>easy</emphasis> we mean easy to deploy, manage, upgrade and
scale.  We are driven by this goal to help deliver the computational power
of clusters to a wide range of scientific users.  It is clear that making
stable and manageable parallel computing platforms available to a wide
range of scientists will aid immensely in improving the state of the art
in parallel tools.
