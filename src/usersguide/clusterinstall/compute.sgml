	This presents a screen that looks like:

	<warning>
	<para>
	If your frontend and compute nodes are connected via a managed
	ethernet switch, you'll want to select 'Ethernet Switches' from 
	the list above.
	This is because the default behavior of many managed ethernet switches
	is to issue DHCP requests in order to receive an IP address that
	clients can use to configure and monitor the switch.
	</para>

	<para>
	When <computeroutput>insert-ethers</computeroutput> captures the DHCP
	request for the managed switch, it will configure it as an ethernet
	switch and store that information in the MySQL database on the
	frontend.
	</para>

	<para>
	As a side note, you may have to wait several minutes before the
	ethernet switch broadcasts its DHCP request.
	If after 10 minutes (or if
	<computeroutput>insert-ethers</computeroutput> has correctly detected
	and configured the ethernet switch), then you should quit
	<computeroutput>insert-ethers</computeroutput> by hitting the
	<computeroutput>F8</computeroutput> key.
	</para>

	<para>
	Now, restart <computeroutput>insert-ethers</computeroutput> and
	continue reading below to configure your compute nodes.
	</para>
	</warning>

	<para>
	Take the default selection, <computeroutput>Compute</computeroutput>,
	hit 'Ok'.

	Power up the first compute node.

	<note>
	<para>
	The BIOS boot order of your compute nodes should be: CD,
	PXE (Network Boot), Hard Disk.
	</para>

	<para>
	If your compute nodes don't support PXE,
	then you'll need to boot your compute nodes with the Kernel Roll CD.
	</para>

	<para>
	If you don't have a CD drive in your compute nodes and if the
	network adapters in your compute nodes don't support PXE,
	see <xref linkend="floppy-boot">.

	<para>
	When the frontend machine receives the DHCP request from the compute

		<imagedata fileref="images/insert-ethers-3.png" scale=50>

	</mediaobject>
      
	<para>
	This indicates that <computeroutput>insert-ethers</computeroutput>
	received the DHCP request from the compute node, inserted it into the
	database and updated all configuration files (e.g.,
	<computeroutput>/etc/hosts, /etc/dhcpd.conf</computeroutput> and DNS).
	</para>

	<para>
	The above screen will be displayed for a few seconds and then you'll

<para>
In the above image, insert-ethers has discovered a
compute node.
The "( )" next to compute-0-0 indicates the node has not yet requested a
kickstart file.
You will see this type of output for each compute node that is successfully identified by insert-ethers. 
</para>

<para>
<emphasis>Figure:</emphasis> The compute node has successfully requested a kickstart file from the frontend. If there are no more compute nodes, you may now quit insert-ethers. Kickstart files are retrieved via HTTPS. If there was an error during the transmission, the error code will be visible instead of "*".

	<para>
	At this point, you can monitor the installation by using
	<computeroutput>rocks-console</computeroutput>.
	Just extract the name of the installing compute node from the
	<computeroutput>insert-ethers</computeroutput> output (in the example
	above, the compute node name is
	<computeroutput>compute-0-0</computeroutput>), and execute:
	</para>

<screen>
# rocks-console compute-0-0

	<para>
	After you've installed all the compute nodes in a cabinet,
	quit <computeroutput>insert-ethers</computeroutput> by hitting
	the 'F8' key.
	</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
	<para>
	After you've installed all the compute nodes in the first cabinet and
	you wish to install the compute nodes in the next cabinet, just
	start <computeroutput>insert-ethers</computeroutput> like:
	</para>

<screen>
# insert-ethers --cabinet=1
</screen>

	<para>
	This will name all new compute nodes like
