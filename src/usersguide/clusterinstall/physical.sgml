<para>
The first thing to manage is the physical deployment of a cluster. Much
research exists on the topic of how to physically construct a cluster.
A majority of the <ulink url="http://www.oreilly.com">O'Reilly
Book</ulink> <emphasis>Building Linux Clusters</emphasis> is devoted to
the physical setup of a cluster, how to choose a motherboard, etc.
Finally, the book <emphasis>How to Build a Beowulf</emphasis> also has
some good tips on physical construction.

<para>
We favor rack-mounted equipment because of its relative reliability and
density.
There are Rocks clusters, however, that are built from mini-towers.
Choose what makes sense for you.

<para>
The following diagram shows how the frontend and compute nodes must be
connected:

<para>
On the compute nodes, the Ethernet interface that Linux maps to
<emphasis> eth0 </emphasis> should be connected to the cluster's Ethernet
switch.
This network is considered <emphasis>private</emphasis>, that is, all
traffic on this network is physically separated from the external public
network (e.g., the internet).
</para>

<para>
On the frontend, at least two ethernet interfaces are required.
The interface that Linux maps to <emphasis> eth0 </emphasis> should be connected
to the same ethernet network as the compute nodes.
The interface that Linux maps to <emphasis> eth1 </emphasis> should  be
connected to the external network (e.g., the internet or your organization's
intranet).
