<title>Enabling Public Web Access to Your Frontend</title>

<para>
To permenantly enable selected web access to the cluster from other
machines on the public network, follow the steps below. Apache's access 
control directives will provide protection for the most sensitive parts of the
cluster web site, however some effort will be necessary to make effective use of them.
</para>

<warning>
<para>
HTTP (web access protocol) is a clear-text channel into your cluster. 
Although the Apache webserver is mature and well tested, security holes 
in the PHP engine have been found and exploited. Opening web access to the
outside world by following the instructions below will make your
cluster more prone to malicious attacks and breakins.
</para>
</warning>

<para>
To open port 80 (the 'www' service) for the public
network of frontend, execute:
</para>

<screen>
# rocks open host firewall localhost network=public protocol=tcp service=www
</screen>

<para>
Then we can see the what the resulting firewall rules will look like:
</para>

<screen>
<![CDATA[
# rocks report host firewall localhost
<file name="/etc/sysconfig/iptables" perms="500">
*nat
-A POSTROUTING -o eth1 -j MASQUERADE
COMMIT

*filter
:INPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
:FORWARD DROP [0:0]
:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]
-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -i eth0 -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -i eth1 -o eth0 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i eth0 -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i eth1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i eth1 -p tcp --dport https -m state --state NEW --source &Kickstart_PublicNetwork;/&Kickstart_PublicNetmask; -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i eth1 -p tcp --dport ssh -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i eth1 -p tcp --dport www -m state --state NEW --source &Kickstart_PublicNetwork;/&Kickstart_PublicNetmask; -j ACCEPT
-A INPUT -i eth1 -p tcp --dport www -j ACCEPT
# block mysql traffic from non-private interfaces
-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 3306 -j REJECT
# block foundation mysql traffic from non-private interfaces
-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 40000 -j REJECT
# block ganglia traffic from non-private interfaces
-A INPUT -p udp --dport 8649 -j REJECT
-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 0:1024 -j REJECT
-A INPUT -p udp --dport 0:1024 -j REJECT
COMMIT
</file>
]]>
</screen>

<para>
In the above example, eth0 is associated with the private network and
eth1 is associated with the public network.
</para>

<para>
Notice the line: "-A INPUT -i eth1 -p tcp --dport www -j ACCEPT".
This is the line in the firewall configuration that will allow web traffic from
any source to flow in and out of the frontend.
This line was added to your firewall configuration with the "rocks open host
firewall" command that you executed.
</para>

<para>
Also, notice the line:
<![CDATA["-A INPUT -i eth1 -p tcp --dport www -m state --state NEW --source &Kickstart_PublicNetwork;/&Kickstart_PublicNetmask; -j ACCEPT"]]>.
This default Rocks firewall rule allows web traffic
from <emphasis>your local public subnet</emphasis> to flow in and out of the
frontend.
</para>

<para>
Now apply the configuration to the host:
</para>

<screen>
# rocks sync host firewall localhost
</screen>

<para>
The host will now accept web traffic on its public interface.
</para>


<para>
Test your changes by pointing a web browser to 
<literal>http://my.cluster.org/</literal>,
where "my.cluster.org" is the DNS name of your frontend machine. 
</para>

<tip>
<para>
If you cannot connect to this address, the problem is most
likely in your network connectivity between your web browser and
the cluster. Check that you can ping the frontend machine from
the machine running the web browser, that you can ssh into it, etc.
</para>
</tip>
