<section><title>Virtual LANs (VLANs) and Logical VLAN Bridges</title>
<para>
Linux supports VLAN tagging on virtual interfaces (i.e. IEEE 802.1Q).  For example, if a host  has
physical interface eth0 (untagged), then the kernel can send and receive a tagged packets if a properly 
defined interface named eth0.&lt;vlan&gt; has been created and properly configured. Tagging allows the same 
physical network to be partitioned into many different networks. A key feature of VLAN tagging is that
a broadcast packet (e.g. a DHCPDISCOVER packet) only broadcasts on the tagged VLAN in which is was initially 
sent.
</para>
<para>
Rocks supports two types of VLAN interfaces - the first is an explicit device name like eth0.10 that is defined
on a particular physical interface. The second is a logical device name of the form "vlan*".  In Rocks, the physical VLAN device can also have an IP address associated with it, however a logical VLAN device cannot.  
We use logical VLANs to construct bridges suitable for virtual clusters.

<title>Physical VLAN Devices</title>
<para>
Physical VLAN devices are interfaces associated with specific physical interfaces. While eth0 is used as
an example, any physical IP interface can have a VLAN associated with it.

Use the following example to add a physical VLAN device, assign a tag, and an IP address:

<title>Logical VLAN Devices</title>
<para>
The second kind of VLAN interface that Rocks supports is what we call a
<emphasis>logical VLAN device</emphasis>. The Virtual
VLAN gives the ability of having a raw interface with no IP address assigned that is generally used as a bridge
for virtual machines. Virtual VLAN devices have their subnet=&lt;subnet of physical&gt;

<para> 
At this stage, the vlan interfaces are not currently associated with any physical network device.  Linux
will not configure these devices on the node without the association. We overload the meaning of subnet in
this case to mean: "associate the logical vlan device with the physical device that is in subnet 'x'". As an 
example, we can associate both vlan2 and vlan3 to be tagged packet interfaces on the the subnet named private.
