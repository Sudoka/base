<section id="networking-ipmi"><title>Configuring IPMI interfaces</title>
<para>
The Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is a standardized 
computer system interface used by system administrators to manage a 
computer system and monitor its operation. IPMI can be used to remotely 
power cycle a server, remotely connect to its KVM or serial interface and 
perform other administrative related functionalities.
The standard is supported by most hardware vendor (Dell, HP, NEC, Intel, 
SuperMicro, etc.) and it is found on several server platforms under 
different name (ILOM, BMC, DRAC, etc.).

<para>

Rocks by default include <ulink url="http://openipmi.sourceforge.net/"> 
openIPMI</ulink> an Open Source command line implementation 
of the standard on all the nodes and it is possible to create the initial 
configuration of the devices leveraging Rocks database and Rocks command line.

<title>Configuring a IPMI Device</title>
<para>
Rocks uses its data base to keep configuration information regarding the
various IPMI devices. All interfaces defined in the rocks database named 
"ipmi" are treated as IPMI devices and not as standard ethernet devices.
</para>
<para>
To configure a IPMI device on a node called compute-0-0 it is 
good practice to define a network to allocate all the IPMI devices 
(although not necessary).
In the following example it is called admin. 
</para>
<screen>

 # rocks add network admin subnet=10.10.0.0 netmask=255.255.0.0 mtu=1500
 # rocks add host interface compute-0-0 ipmi ip=10.10.255.254 name=ipmi-compute-0-0 subnet=admin
 # rocks set host interface channel compute-0-0 ipmi 1

</screen>
<para>
The channel is used to specify which comunication interface should be configured.
Each IPMI device supports multiple comunication interfaces (Ethernet/IP, serial ports, etc.) so 
it is necessary to identify which one is associated with the Ethernet interface and 
use it when setting the channel with the rocks command. Different hardware can have 
different channels for the same type of device.
To this purpose it is possible to use ipmitool command repeatedly 
with different channel numbers, untill the Medium info display 
802 LAN, as in the following example:
</para>
<screen>

 # ipmitool channel info 1
Channel 0x1 info:
 Channel Medium Type     : 802.3 LAN
 Channel Protocol Type   : IPMB-1.0
 ...

</screen>
<para>
The admin password is set by default to "admin", it is possible 
to change it using the rocks attribute "ipmi_password".
In most of the IPMI devices the admin user ID is equal to 1.
If a device set up in a different way it is possible to set the 
attribute "ipmi_admin_user_number" and change this default behavior.
</para>

<para>
The command  rocks sync network compute-0-0-0 will create a script on 
compute-0-0-0 in /etc/sysconfig/ipmi which should be executed manually 
on the node to finalize the configuration.
</para>
<screen>

 # rocks sync network compute-0-0
 # ssh compute-0-0
 # bash /etc/sysconfig/ipmi

</screen>
<para>
After this you IPMI interface should be properly configured.
