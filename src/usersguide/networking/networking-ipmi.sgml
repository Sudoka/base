<section id="networking-ipmi"><title>Configuring IPMI interfaces</title>
<para>
The Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is a standardized 
computer system interface used by system administrators to manage a 
computer system and monitor its operation. IPMI can be used to remotely 
power cycle a server, remotely connect to its KVM or serial interface and 
perform other administrative related functionalities.
The standard is supported by most hardware vendor (Dell, HP, NEC, Intel, 
SuperMicro, etc.) and it is found on several server platforms under 
different name (ILOM, BMC, DRAC, etc.).

<para>

Rocks by default include <ulink url="http://openipmi.sourceforge.net/"> 
openIPMI</ulink> an Open Source command line implementation 
of the standard on all the nodes and it is possible to create the initial 
configuration of the devices leveraging Rocks database and Rocks command line.

<title>Configuring a IPMI Device</title>
<para>
Rocks uses its data base to keep configuration information regarding the
various IPMI devices. All interfaces defined in the rocks database named 
"ipmi" are treated as IPMI devices and not as standard ethernet devices.
</para>
<para>
It is good practice to define a network to allocate all the IPMI devices 
(although not necessary). IPMI network are sometimes separated from other 
network for security purposes, other times they can share the existing 
network infrastructure to save money. The network configuration and design 
is behind the scope of this tutorial. We simply assume All the nodes are 
connected to the admin network (10.10.0.0/255.255.0.0) and the frontend 
has some routing access to it.

In the following example can be used to define the admin network in the 
rocks DB.
</para>
<screen>
 # rocks add network admin subnet=10.10.0.0 netmask=255.255.0.0 mtu=1500
</screen>

<para>
To configure a IPMI device on a node called compute-0-0, you should run:
</para>

<screen>

 # rocks add host interface compute-0-0 ipmi ip=10.10.255.254 name=ipmi-compute-0-0 subnet=admin
 # rocks set host interface channel compute-0-0 ipmi 1

</screen>
<para>
The channel is used to specify which comunication interface should be configured.
Each IPMI device supports multiple comunication devices (Ethernet/IP, serial ports, etc.) so 
it is necessary to identify which one is associated with the Ethernet interface to 
specify it with the rocks set host interface channel command. Different hardware can have 
different channels for the same type of device.
To this purpose it is possible to use ipmitool command repeatedly 
with different channel numbers, untill the Medium info display 
802 LAN, as in the following example:
</para>
<screen>

 # ipmitool channel info 1
Channel 0x1 info:
 Channel Medium Type     : 802.3 LAN
 Channel Protocol Type   : IPMB-1.0
 ...

</screen>
<para>
The admin password is set by default to "admin", it is possible 
to change it using the rocks attribute "ipmi_password".
In most of the IPMI devices the admin user ID is equal to 1.
If a device set up in a different way it is possible to set the 
attribute "ipmi_admin_user_number" and change this default behavior.
</para>

<para>
The command  rocks sync network compute-0-0-0 will create a script on 
compute-0-0-0 in /etc/sysconfig/ipmi which should be executed manually 
on the node to finalize the configuration.
</para>
<screen>

 # rocks sync host network compute-0-0
 # ssh compute-0-0
 # bash /etc/sysconfig/ipmi

</screen>
<para>
After this your IPMI interface should be properly configured.
To validate your configuration you can use the ipmitool command from your frontend 
(or from the node which has access to the admin network) as shown in the following 
example:
</para>

<screen>
ipmitool -H 10.10.255.254 -U ADMIN -P admin power status
</screen>

<para>
To power off compute-0-0, execute:
</para>

<screen>
# ipmitool -H 10.10.255.254 -U ADMIN -P admin power off
</screen>

<para>
To power compute-0-0 back on, execute:
</para>

<screen>
# ipmitool -H 10.10.255.254 -U ADMIN -P admin power on
</screen>

<para>
There are several more management tasks you can perform with ipmitool.
See the man page for ipmitool for more details.
