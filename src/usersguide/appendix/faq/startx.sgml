<answer>

	<para>
	Before you can run startx you need to configure XFree86 for
	your video card.  This is done just like on standard Red Hat machines
	using the <computeroutput>system-config-display</computeroutput>
        program.  If you do not know anything about
	your video card just select "4MB" of video RAM and 16 bit
	color 800x600.  This video mode should work on any modern VGA
	card.
