When I run the ethernet version of Linpack
(<computeroutput>/usr/share/mpi/bin/mpirun -nolocal -np 2
-machinefile machines /opt/hpl-eth/bin/xhpl</computeroutput>), 
I get the error: "Program /opt/hpl-eth/bin/xhpl either does not exist, is not
executable, or is an erroneous argument to mpirun."
What's up?

<answer>
<para>
<computeroutput>mpirun</computeroutput> requires that the executable be
present on the node that is lauching the job, even if it is launched
with the flag <computeroutput>-nolocal</computeroutput>.
</para>

The workaround is to add the ethernet version hpl to your frontend, by
logging into your frontend and executing:
</para>

<screen>
# rpm -Uvh /home/install/rocks-dist/7.2/en/os/i386/RedHat/RPMS/hpl-eth-1.0-0.i386.rpm
</screen>
