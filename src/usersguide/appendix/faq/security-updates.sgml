	What security patches should I be running with Rocks?
	</para>
</question>

<answer>

        <para>

	Every Rocks release is a snapshot of the most up to date
	software packages from Red Hat for whatever release Rocks is
	based on.  For example, Rocks 2.2 included all the Red Hat 7.2
	updates on the of our release.  If you use rocks-dist to
	mirror your distribution from us you will get updates to our
	software and some Red Hat updates as we see fit to push them
	out. There is no automated method of updating the software
	packages on your frontend machine.  This means you will have
	to treat it like any other machine on the Internet and track
	security updates yourself and updates vulnerable services.
	Only you can decide what level of security is appropriate for
	your site.  Some sites prefer to secure only network services
	while others secure the network and local host services.

	</para>

	<para>

	The default Rocks configuration sets up and a firewall on the
	frontend and permits only SSH traffic into the cluster.  The
	minimum security requirement is to track SSH updates and apply
	them to your frontend when needed.
