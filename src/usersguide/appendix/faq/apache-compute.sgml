	Why is apache running on my compute nodes?

</question>

<answer>

        <para>

	The default configuration for compute nodes is to start the
	Apache service.  This is enabled to allow us to serve (over
	HTTP) the Linux /proc filesystem to a future monitoring tool.
	UCB's Ganglia will remain the prefered monitoring tool, but
	for highly detailed node information only the complete /proc
	filesystem will suffice.  To disable this feature remove the
	following line from your distribution's configuration graph.
