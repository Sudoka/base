<question id="no-dhcp">
<para>
Insert-ethers never sees new compute nodes. I also don't see any DHCP messages
from compute nodes on the frontend. What is wrong?

swich may be configured to squash broadcast messages from unknown IP addresses,
which drops DHCP messages from nodes. To verify your switch is indeed the

<para>
Connect an ethernet cable 
between a single compute node and the frontend's "eth0" interface.

<para>
Install the compute node normally (<xref linkend="install-compute-nodes">).
You should see the DHCP messages from the node at the frontend.
