	<para>
	Why can't I re-kickstart compute nodes?  Shoot-node fails, and
	power cycling the machine doesn't force a re-install.
	</para>
</question>

<answer>

        <para>
	Older BIOS versions required the boot image to reside in the
	first GB of the hard disk.  If the boot image, in this case
	the kickstart kernel image, resides after the first GB of the
	disk the image will not be loaded by GRUB.  Update your BIOS
	and this problem should get fixed.
