<question id="kickstart-file">

<para>
While trying to bring up my frontend, I boot from the Rocks CD, type
'frontend' at the boot prompt, insert my floppy and I see the error message
'Error opening kickstart file /tmp/ks.cfg. No such file or directory'.
What went wrong?

<answer>
<para>
There are two common modes for this problem:
</para>

<orderedlist>
	<listitem> <para>
	The file <emphasis>ks.cfg</emphasis> is not saved on the floppy as
	a <emphasis>Unix</emphasis> text file, or
	</para> </listitem>

	<listitem> <para>
	Your floppy media is bad.
	</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>

<para>
To deal with #1, mount the floppy and make sure the 'end of line' is
'line feed' (ASCII character '\n' -- the Unix way) and not 'carriage return
+ line feed' (ASCII characters '\r\n' -- the DOS way).
</para>

<para>
To verify the <emphasis>ks.cfg</emphasis> file on your floppy, execute:
</para>

<screen>
# mount /mnt/floppy
# od -c /mnt/floppy/ks.cfg | more
</screen>

<para>
You should see output similar to:
</para>

<screen>
0000000   #       @   C   o   p   y   r   i   g   h   t   @  \n   #    
0000020  \n   #      \t  \t  \t                       N   P   A   C   I
0000040       R   o   c   k   s  \n   #      \t  \t  \t                
0000060   V   e   r   s   i   o   n       2   .   2  \n   #      \n   #
</screen>

<para>
Notice the '\n' characters (and not '\r\n').
</para>

<para>
If your <emphasis>ks.cfg</emphasis> file is ok, then throw away your
floppy and copy <emphasis>ks.cfg</emphasis> onto a new floppy.
During the testing of releases, we go through at least 5 floppies -- to
sum it up in two words: floppies stink.
