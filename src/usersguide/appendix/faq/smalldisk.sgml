<question id="cant-mount">
<para>
When I try to install a compute node, the error message on the compute node 
says, "Can't mount /tmp. Please press OK to restart".
What should I do?
</para>
</question>

<answer>
<para>
Most likely, this situation arises due to the size of the disk drive on the compute
node.
The installation procedure for Rocks formats the disk on the compute node if Rocks
has never been installed on the compute node before.
</para>

<para>
The fix requires changing the way Rocks partitions disk drives.
See <xref linkend="customization-partitioning"> for details.
