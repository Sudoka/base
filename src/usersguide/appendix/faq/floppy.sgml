<question id="floppy">
<para>
My compute nodes don't have a CD drive and my network cards don't PXE
boot, but my compute nodes do have a floppy drive.
How can I install the compute nodes?

<answer>
<para>
You will create a boot floppy that emulates the PXE protocol.
This is accomplished by going to the web site:
</para>

<para>
<ulink url="http://www.rom-o-matic.net/">ROM-o-matic.net</ulink>
</para>

<para>
Then click on the version number under the
<emphasis>Latest Production Release</emphasis> (as of this writing,
this is version 5.4.3).
</para>

<para>
Select your device driver in item 1.
Keep the default setting in item 2 (Floppy bootable ROM Image).
Then click "Get ROM" in item 4.
</para>

<para>
We suggest using <computeroutput>dd</computeroutput> to copy the
downloaded floppy image to the floppy media.
For example:
</para>

<screen>
# dd if=eb-5.4.0-pcnet32.zdsk of=/dev/fd0
</screen>

<para>
Then run <computeroutput>insert-ethers</computeroutput> on your frontend
and boot your compute node with the floppy.
</para>
