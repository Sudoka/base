<title> Access to Rocks Source Code </title>

<para>
The source code for Rocks is available from a public read-only <ulink url="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mercurial</ulink> repository.  
As of Rocks 5.0 Mercurial (hg) is installed on your frontend machine, for older version of Rocks (or non-Rocks platforms) you will need to install the Mercurial package yourself.
Binary packages for Mercurial are available <ulink url="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/BinaryPackages">here</ulink>.

<para>
Mercurial is a distributed source control system.  
A very good explanation on how this differs from CVS is available on the Mercurial <ulink url="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/CvsConcepts">site</ulink>.
Fundamentally, distributed source control turns your checked out source code from a read-only copy into a repository and then grants read-write access to others based on your checked out repository.
In the context of Rocks this means individual Roll developers can independently control who has access to their code.

<para>
To check out the current source code you will first need to clone the master Rocks read-only repository as follows.  This operation will take several minutes (if not hours) and unlike a CVS checkout it may appear to hang, be patient.
