<title> Access to Rocks Source Code </title>

<para>
The source code for Rocks is available from a public read-only <ulink url="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/">Mercurial</ulink> repository.  
As of Rocks 5.0 Mercurial (hg) is installed on your frontend machine, for older version of Rocks (or non-Rocks platforms) you will need to install the Mercurial package yourself.
Binary packages for Mercurial are available <ulink url="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/BinaryPackages">here</ulink>.

Mercurial is a distributed source control system.  
A very good explanation on how this differs from CVS is available on the Mercurial <ulink url="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/CvsConcepts">site</ulink>.
Fundamentally, distributed source control turns your checked out source code from a read-only copy into a repository and then grants read-write access to others based on your checked out repository.
In the context of Rocks this means individual Roll developers can independently control who has access to their code.

<para>
To check out the current source code you will first need to clone master Rocks read-only repository as follows.  This operation will take several minutes (if not hours) and unlike a CVS checkout it may appear to hang, be patient.

Once you have your own cloned repository, just like with CVS, you will want to update the your copy of the code to the head of the tree.  
This is done with the following Mercurial operations.
