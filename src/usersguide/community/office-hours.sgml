Another mode in which to get support for Rocks is through "Office Hours".
The idea is to have a set time in which members of the Rocks community can
have a one-on-one live conversation with a Rocks developer.

Office Hours is held every Tuesday from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM Pacific Time.
If that time slot is inconvienient for you, send a note to
officehours@rocksclusters.org and we'll try to set up an appointment.

Video conference calls are preferred, but not required.
