	<title> Building Your Roll </title>


<para>
In this section, we'll show you how to build your roll and we'll examine
some of the files that are created when you build your roll.
</para>

<para>
Building your roll is rather simple.
To build the example Valgrind Roll that we developed in the previous
section, execute:
</para>

<screen>
# cd /export/src/roll/valgrind
# make roll
</screen>

<para>
This will take several minutes to build.
When it completes, the most important file is
<constant>valgrind-1.0-0.x86_64.disk1.iso</constant> --
this is the Valgrind Roll in an ISO image.
You can burn this ISO to a CD/DVD or you can transport it to a frontend and
install it like you would any other roll.
</para>

<para>
When you execute "make roll", it will descend into the
<constant>src</constant> directory and try to build every package.
In the case of the Valgrind Roll, there are two subdirectories under
<constant>src</constant>: usersguide and valgrind.
The "make roll" process will go into each of those directories and execute
"make rpm".
And as decribed in the section <xref linkend="internals-packages-src">, the
resulting RPMs will be placed in
<constant>/export/src/roll/valgrind/RPMS/x86_64</constant>.
</para>

<para>
Also, all the node XML files and the graph XML file will be bundled into
a package called
<constant>roll-valgrind-kickstart-1.0-0.noarch.rpm</constant>.
To see this, execute:
</para>

<screen>
# cd /export/src/roll/valgrind
# rpm -qlp RPMS/noarch/roll-valgrind-kickstart-1.0-0.noarch.rpm 
/export/profile
/export/profile/graphs
/export/profile/graphs/default
/export/profile/graphs/default/valgrind.xml
/export/profile/nodes
/export/profile/nodes/valgrind-base.xml
/export/profile/nodes/valgrind-client.xml
/export/profile/nodes/valgrind-server.xml
/export/profile/roll-valgrind.xml
</screen>

<para>
Above we see the graph XML file (
<constant>/export/profile/graphs/default/valgrind.xml</constant>)
and the node XML files:
(<constant>/export/profile/nodes/valgrind-base.xml</constant>,
<constant>/export/profile/nodes/valgrind-client.xml</constant>,
<constant>/export/profile/nodes/valgrind-server.xml</constant>).
The file <constant>/export/profile/roll-valgrind.xml</constant> contains
info that describes how the roll was built.
</para>
