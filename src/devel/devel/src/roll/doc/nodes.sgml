<para>
Inside the <computeroutput>nodes</computeroutput> directory, you will put your
Rocks-based XML configuration files.
These files are used to install packages and to configure their respective
services.

<para>
In the Intel Roll, the file
<computeroutput>roll/intel/nodes/intel.xml</computeroutput>
has the package names for the compilers to be installed on specific hardware
architectures.
For example, the <computeroutput>intel-icc8</computeroutput> is installed
with the line:
</para>

<screen>
&lt;package roll="intel"&gt;intel-icc8&lt;/package&gt;
</screen>

<warning>
<para>
Make note of the attribute <computeroutput>roll="intel"</computeroutput>, this
is important.
Every package that is to be installed by your roll must have this attribute
set to the name of your roll.
This is because the extensions that Rocks adds to RedHat's installer keys off
this value in order to install the packages from your roll CD during the
final stages of a frontend installation.
Without the <emphasis>roll</emphasis> attribute, the RedHat installer will
think the package is on the Rocks Base CD, which it won't be, and the
installation will fail.
</para>
</warning>

<para>
The <computeroutput>&lt;post&gt;</computeroutput> section of the node
<computeroutput>roll/intel/nodes/intel.xml</computeroutput>
shows how the packages are configured after they are installed.
