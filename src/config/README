this package contains the support files used to configure (or reconfigure)
compute nodes.

the files in the 'bootdisk' directory are from the bootnet.img of the red hat
distribution. to keep the 'bootdisk' directory current for future red hat
releases, do:

	- get a working kickstart boot floppy
	- mount the floppy
	- copy the minimal set of files to 'bootdisk'

for red hat 6.2, the "minimal set of files" are:

	initrd.img
	vmlinuz
