# in ananconda 10.1.1.63, when running ekv on the frontend (for a remote
# reinstall), the environment doesn't map 'localhost' to 127.0.0.1 -- so
# let's explicitly tunnel to 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost.

# Changes to shootnode and rocks-console. These changes were necessary to
# support shooting multiple nodes in one command. The threading in shoot-node
# would cause a lot of problems because multiple threads would try to manipulate
# stderr, and all would fail but one.
#
# Also race conditions are created by the presence of threads, and so sockets need
# to be released only at the last possible moment, to avoid multiple bindings.
#
# Revision 1.5  2006/07/10 22:40:40  anoop
# Silly little bug removed.

# Rocks console can connect to multiple servers now without barfing
