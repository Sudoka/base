How to Customize your floppy bootimage

The file FDSTD.288 is a 2.8MB FreeDOS bootable floppy image and hence
this procedure supports DOS-based, floppy flashing programs only.

The FDSTD.288 file was downloaded from 
http://www.fdos.org/bootdisks/autogen/FDSTD.288.gz


1. Place your specific flash files (dos-based flash util, .bin file
and perhaps autoexec.bat) in the addon/  subdirectory

2. # make build
this will create a floppy image called pxeflash-FDSTD.288. This image includes
all files in the addon subdirectory. 

3. # make install
this will copy your floppy image to /tftpboot/pxelinux/pxeflash

4. Set a node to pxeboot from your flash image
# rocks set host boot <hostname> action=pxeflash

You will need to manually reset the node to install or boot mode using
# rocks set host boot <hostname> action=os
